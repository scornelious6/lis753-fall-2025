          The lyrics use gemstone metaphors to visualize failed relationships as dark "onyx" nights, in contrast to happiness as a bright, opalescent sky. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

        <p>
          I had a bad habit. Of missing lovers past. My brother used to call it. Eating out of the trash'. It's never gonna last
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought my house was haunted, I used to live with ghosts. And all the perfect couples. Said, "When you know you know."And, "When you don't you don't."
        </p>
        <p>
          And all of the foes and all of the friends. Have seen it before, they'll see it again. Life is a song, it ends when it ends, I was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my Mama told me, it's alright. You were dancing through the lightning strikes, sleepless in the onyx night. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh, oh my Lord. Never made no one like you before. You had to make your own sunshine. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh oh.
        </p>
        <p>
          You couldn't understand it. Why you felt alone. You were in it for real. She was in her phone and you were just a pose.
        </p>
        <p>
          And don't we try to love love. We give it all we got (we give it all we got). You finally left the table and what a simple thought. You're starving til you're not.
        </p>
        <p>
          And all of the foes and all of the friends. Have messed up before, they'll mess up again. Life is a song, it ends when it ends,you move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's when I told you. It's alright. You were dancing through the lightning strikes. Sleepless in the onyx night. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh, oh my Lord. Never met no one like you before. You had to make your own sunshine. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh oh.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is just a storm inside a teacup. But shelter here with me, my love. Thunder like a drum. This life will beat you up, up, up, up. This is just a temporary speed bump. But failure brings you freedom and I can bring you love, love, love, love, love. Don't you sweat it, baby.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's alright, you were dancing through the lightning strikes. Sleepless in the onyx night. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh, oh my Lord. Never made no one like you before, no. You had to make your own sunshine. But now the sky is opalite. Oh oh oh oh oh.
