In a faith forgotten land. In from the snow. Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow. Tarnished but so grand. And the old widow goes to the stone every day. But I don't, I just sit here and wait. Grieving for the living. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered in you.

On waters so inviting, I almost jump in. But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush. I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush. I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch. Everybody wants you. Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you. Walk past, quick brush. I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush. I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush. Everybody wants you. But I don't like a gold rush

        The Life of a Showgirl prologue poem below.

Coffee. Stretch. Piano keys.
Vocal warm ups in a locker room shower.
Eyelash glue. A photo of him on the mirror.
Sweat and vanilla perfume.
The cracking of joints
and the distant beat of a drum.
The curtain call.
The monstrous thrill of it all.
Plan it out so it doesn't look planned
10 different backup plans
If your red bottomed heel breaks
you will keep strutting
Balancing on the balls of your blistered feet
Know your exits. Shoulders back. Eyes up.
Hit your marks. Your winks. Sparks.
Tell them a story like it's an intimate dinner party.
The looks on their wonderous faces
Their expressions like mood rings
Isn't it all so majestic? Of course it is
It's a lot of other things too

Tonight all these lives converge here
The mosaics of laughter and cocktails of tears
Where fraternal souls sing identical things
And it's beautiful
It's rapturous
It is frightening

It's worth everything it has cast you
And even at your darkest or drunketst,
You wouldn't say any different
Would you?
You would choose all of it again
No matter how the story ends
With the ugliest boos or the loveliest bouquet
They say that love is a choice you make every
single
day
And that is how love.
The life
of
A showgirl
