          <a href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-ivy-lyrics" alt="go to Ivy lyrics by Taylor Swift">Ivy lyrics </a> How's one to know? I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones. In a faith forgotten land. In from the snow. Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow. Tarnished but so grand. And the old widow goes to the stone every day. But I don't, I just sit here and wait. Grieving for the living. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish to know. The fatal flaw that makes you long to be magnificently cursed. He's in the room. Your opal eyes are all I wish to see. He wants what's only yours. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clover blooms in the fields. Spring breaks loose, the time is near. What would he do if he found us out? Crescent moon, coast is clear. Spring breaks loose, but so does fear. He's gonna burn this house to the ground. How's one to know? I'd live and die for moments that we stole, on begged and borrowed time. So tell me to run. Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become. And drink my husband's wine. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered in you. And I'm covered in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah, it's a fire. It's a goddamn blaze in the dark. And you started it. You started it. So yeah, it's a war. It's the goddamn fight of my life. And you started it. You started it. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered. In you. In you, you. Now I'm covered in you. In you.

On waters so inviting, I almost jump in. But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush. I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush. I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch. Everybody wants you. Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you. Walk past, quick brush. I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush. I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush. Everybody wants you. But I don't like a gold rush
        </p>
        <p>
          What must it be like, to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominos. I see me padding 'cross your wooden floors. With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door. At dinner parties. I call you out on your contrarian shit. And the coastal town. We wandered 'round had never. Seen a love as pure as it. And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea. Cause you know it could never be. Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush. I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush. I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch. Everybody wants you. Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you. Walk past, quick brush. I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush. I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush. Everybody wants you. But I don't like a gold rush.

          What must it be like,to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominoes. My mind turns your life into folklore. I can't dare to dream about you anymore. At dinner parties. Won't call you out on your contrarian shit. And the coastal town. We never found will never. See a love as pure as it. Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea. Cause it will never be. Gleaming. Twinkling. Eyes like sinking ships. On waters so inviting. I almost jump in.
