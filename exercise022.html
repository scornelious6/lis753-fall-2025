          <a href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-ivy-lyrics" alt="go to Ivy lyrics by Taylor Swift">Ivy lyrics </a> How's one to know? I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones. In a faith forgotten land. In from the snow. Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow. Tarnished but so grand. And the old widow goes to the stone every day. But I don't, I just sit here and wait. Grieving for the living. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish to know. The fatal flaw that makes you long to be magnificently cursed. He's in the room. Your opal eyes are all I wish to see. He wants what's only yours. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clover blooms in the fields. Spring breaks loose, the time is near. What would he do if he found us out? Crescent moon, coast is clear. Spring breaks loose, but so does fear. He's gonna burn this house to the ground. How's one to know? I'd live and die for moments that we stole, on begged and borrowed time. So tell me to run. Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become. And drink my husband's wine. Oh, goddamn. My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand. Taking mine, but it's been promised to another. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered in you. And I'm covered in you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah, it's a fire. It's a goddamn blaze in the dark. And you started it. You started it. So yeah, it's a war. It's the goddamn fight of my life. And you started it. You started it. Oh, I can't. Stop you putting roots in my dreamland. My house of stone, your ivy grows. And now I'm covered. In you. In you, you. Now I'm covered in you. In you.
