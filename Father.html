          A pop and R&B ballad, it interpolated parts of the melody of George Michael's 1987 song "Father Figure" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_9hfHvQSNo" alt="go to Father Figure by George Michael"> "Father Figure" </a> </p>. Critics have speculated that the song may be inspired by Swift's early career and her masters dispute. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

        <p>
          When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag
Turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me"
I saw potential
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be your father figure
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check's bigger
This love is pure profit
Just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me
I protect the family
Leave it with me
I protect the family
        </p>
        <p>
          I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They want to see you rise. They don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I ask for is your loyalty
My dear protégé
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll be your father figure
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check's bigger
This love is pure profit
Just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets
Leave it with me
I protect the family
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw a change in you
My dear boy
They don't make loyalty like they used to
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me
I protect the family
        </p>
        <p>
          I was your father figure
We drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil turns out my check's bigger
You want a fight, you found it
I got the place surrounded
You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
Whose portrait's on the mantle?
Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
        </p>
        <p>
          I was your father figure
You pulled the wrong trigger
This empire belongs to me
Leave it with me
        </p>
        <p>
          I protect the family
Leave it with me
I protect the family
Leave it with me
"You know, you remind me of a younger me"
I saw potential
