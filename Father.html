          A pop and R&B ballad, it interpolated parts of the melody of George Michael's 1987 song "Father Figure". Critics have speculated that the song may be inspired by Swift's early career and her masters dispute. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

        <p>
          I heard you calling, on the megaphone. You wanna see me all alone. As legend has it you, are quite the pyro, you light the match to watch it blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you'd never come for me, I might've drowned in the melancholy. I swore my loyalty to me, myself and I. Right before you lit my sky up.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that time, I sat alone in my tower. You were just honing your powers. Now I can see it all (see it all). Late one night, you dug me out of my grave and saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep it one hundred, on the land, the sea, the sky. Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes. Don't care where the hell you been, cause now you're mine. It's 'bout to be the sleepless night. You've been dreaming of The fate of Ophelia
        </p>
        <p>
          The eldest daughter of a nobleman, Ophelia lived in fantasy, but love was a cold bed full of scorpions. The venom stole her sanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you'd never come for me. I might've lingered in purgatory. You wrap around me like a chain, a crown, a vine. Pulling me into the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that time, I sat alone in my tower, you were just honing your powers. Now I can see it all (see it all). Late one night, you dug me out of my grave and saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia.

        </p>
        <p>
          'Tis locked inside my memory. And only you possess the key. No longer drowning and deceived. All because you came for me. Locked inside my memory and only you possess the key. No longer drowning and deceived. All because you came for me.
